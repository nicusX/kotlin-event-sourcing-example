# Event-Sourcing minimalistic example in Kotlin

Learning excercise, implementing a very simple Event-Sourcing, based on [Greg Young's SimpleCQRS](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r),
in Kotlin.

The quality of code is suboptimal: the original SimpleCQRS example is very old-fashioned-OOP, everything-mutable code. 
I am improving some aspects without diverging too much from the original architecture.
